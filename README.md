# House Price Prediction and Analysis Using King County Housing Data

## DA 591 - Final Semester Project

**Team Members**: Ashwin, Ashwath, Namrata Mane

---

## Project Overview

Housing prices in King County vary widely due to location, size, and property features. This project aims to build a data-driven model to predict house prices and help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Dataset

- **Source**: King County Housing Dataset
- **Records**: ~21,613 house sales
- **Features**: 21 columns including price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, location, etc.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Data Cleaning ✅
- Load and explore the dataset
- Handle missing values and duplicates
- Convert data types
- Feature engineering

### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Upcoming)
- Statistical analysis
- Visualizations
- Correlation analysis

### Phase 3: Model Building (Upcoming)
- Linear Regression for price prediction
- Model evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the notebooks in order

## Deliverables

1. Cleaned and prepared dataset
2. Trained Linear Regression price prediction model
3. Clear insights on key factors influencing house prices
